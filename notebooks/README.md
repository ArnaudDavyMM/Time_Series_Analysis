**Purpose:** Train forecasting models using statistical and machine learning techniques.

---

### 📊 `model_evaluation/`  
**Performance assessment and diagnostics**

- `metrics_comparison.ipynb` – Evaluates models using RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and other relevant metrics  
- `confusion_matrix.ipynb` – Visualizes classification performance and error distribution  

**Purpose:** Compare models, identify weaknesses, and select the best-performing approach.

---

### 📈 `results_visualization/`  
**Final visualizations and dashboards**

- `forecast_dashboard.ipynb` – Interactive plots and summary dashboards for presentation  
- `trend_analysis.ipynb` – Visual breakdown of store-level and temporal trends  

**Purpose:** Communicate insights and model outputs through compelling visual narratives.
