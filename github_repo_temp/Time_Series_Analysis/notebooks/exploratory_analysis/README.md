# ðŸ§­ Exploration & Analysis

This folder contains notebooks for initial data exploration, preprocessing, and feature engineering using the Rossmann Store Sales dataset.

## ðŸ““ Included Notebooks
- `eda_feat_engineering.ipynb`
    â€“ statistical exploration of trends, seasonality, and anomalies  
- `trends_impact_analysis.ipynb`
    â€“ Creation of time-based features, lag variables, and rolling statistics
    â€“ Cleans and transforms raw data, and prepares inputs for modeling

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Perform quality checks (missing values, outliers, data types)  
- Clean and preprocess raw data for modeling readiness  
- Identify patterns and relationships in the dataset  
- Engineer enriched features for downstream modeling
