📈 Time Series Forecasting for Retail Sales

Dataset: Rossmann Store Sales


🎯 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting retail time series data to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights. By combining exploratory analysis, feature engineering, statistical methods, and machine learning, it aims to improve prediction accuracy and support data-driven business decisions. Use Case: Sales forecasting, inventory optimization, and demand planning across retail channels.

Due to computational constraints both on Google Colab (especially GPU limits) and locally CPU, the project is divided into four main parts for performance efficiency:

📂 **Sub-Projects Included**
---

🧭 **1. Data Ingestion, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

This stage focuses on understanding the raw dataset and its structure:

  - Data Ingestion: Loading and preprocessing retail time series data.

  - Quality Checks: Identifying missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

  - Exploratory Deep Dive: Uncovering trends, seasonality, anomalies, and insights through initial visualizations and descriptive statistics.
  

🛠️ **2. Feature Engineering & Visualization**

Building better predictors and visual context for modeling:

  - Feature Creation: Generating new time-based features, lag variables, and rolling statistics.

  - Correlation Analysis: Investigating interdependencies between variables.

  - Advanced Visualization: Crafting informative plots to showcase patterns and relationships.
  

📊 **3.1 Statistical Modeling**

Applying traditional models to understand and predict temporal patterns:

  - Time Series Forecasting: Utilizing models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Exponential Smoothing.

  - Model Evaluation: Measuring accuracy and performance with appropriate metrics.
  
  
🤖 **3.2 Machine Learning / Deep Learning Models**

This section focuses on widely adopted forecasting techniques in the data science domain. We will implement and evaluate several standard algorithms, including:

 - Statistical Models: ARIMA, SARIMA

 - Ensemble Methods: XGBoost, LightGBM

 - Facebook Prophet: A robust model for time series forecasting with built-in seasonality and holiday effects

 - Deep Learning Models: LSTM, Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT), N-BEATS
 

🚀 **4. Hybrid Time Series Architecture**

An evolving framework that integrates multiple state-of-the-art models—such as Prophet, LightGBM, ARIMA, TFT, and LSTM—to effectively capture both linear trends and complex non-linear patterns. These hybrid models handle seasonality, holidays, and external features while maximizing predictive performance through intelligent residual learning.

**Hybrid combinations for enhanced performance:**

 - ARIMA + XGBoost or LightGBM
 
 - Prophet + XGBoost or LightGBM
     
 - Prophet + LSTM
     
 - ARIMA + TFT

💻 **Development Environment**

This project is primarily developed and executed locally, with Google Colab used selectively for one sub-project to leverage GPU resources.

🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**

Most work was done locally to maintain flexibility and control over system resources.

  - Core programming language : Python 3.11.8

  - Used for scripting, modeling, and data processing
    
  - Jyputer Lab : Primary interface for experimentation and iterative development

  - Google Colab : Utilized briefly for one GPU-constrained sub-task

  - Open-source license

  - Actively maintained and updated

🚀 **Why Use Google Colab?**

Colab was selectively used to overcome local hardware limitations.

  - 💡 Only applied to GPU-intensive training task

  - ❌ Not suitable for full development due to limited session duration, unpredictable GPU availability, and memory constraints

💬 **Notes**

   - Prefer running locally for speed and reliability

   - Colab is only recommended for replicating GPU-bound training step if needed

   - Consider switching to other cloud platforms for more robust GPU options
